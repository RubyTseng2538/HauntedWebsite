<p>
  Beauty products with natural ingredients are not necessarily better than chemical-based products if the raw material production is unsustainable. 
</p>
<p>
  Palm oil is one of the most used beauty product ingredients, popular both for its effects on the body and the planet. The high demand for palm oil has led to unsustainable extensive cultivation. Palm oil plantation encroachment has destroyed natural forests, and countless animal species have lost their natural habitats. Other cosmetics industry oil sources like soy, rapeseed, and coconut perform no better than palm oil when not sustainably cultivated as well.
  </p>
  <p>
  The beauty industry’s unsustainable consumption is not exclusive to natural resources. Non-renewable natural resources like fossil fuels and metals are also affected. Single-use items also contribute to waste in the beauty industry. We often use items like wet wipes, sheet masks, and blotting sheets only once before trashing them. When we compare the process and costs to the ecosystem, single-use items are not such a great idea for sustainable living.
