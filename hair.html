  From our bathrooms to spending hot summer days at the beach, toxic chemicals in beauty products leach into the oceans from our bodies. Shampoos, sunscreens, creams, and lotions sometimes contain chemicals harmful to humans and wildlife when they get into the environment.
</p>
<p>
  Parabens and triclosan are chemicals found in a variety of cosmetic products acting as preservatives. For example, some sunscreen products contain benzophenone or its derivative oxybenzone.
</p>
<p>
  These chemicals have been tagged as endocrine disruptors and linked with cancer2. Fourteen thousand tons of sunscreen get into the ocean and settle on coral reefs every year. Oxybenzone is a culprit in the massive destruction of coral reefs in the world's oceans.
  </p>
  <p>
  Chemical ingredients like BHT, sodium Laureth sulfate, and BHA have been found to cause changes to the biochemistry of aquatic life. They reduce the animal plankton population, and sometimes these toxic chemicals result in fish death.
  </p>
  <p>
  Even after sewage treatment, some of these chemicals remain in our water supply.
