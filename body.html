  Testing cosmetics on animals could be inhumane and unnecessary. Cruelty-Free International argues animal experiments are ineffective since they do not even get many human diseases. Scientists artificially introduce these diseases in a laboratory setting that does not necessarily mimic the real-life situations of humans.
</p>
<p>
  There have been decades of studies highlighting where lab animals recovered from incurable human diseases. However, the cure may still not work on humans. 90% of drugs do not work on humans even after successful animal testing.
  </p>
  <p>
  The Chinese government used to require animal testing for cosmetics but has largely now relaxed this policy. As of 2021, China still requires animal testing for imported 'special use' cosmetics like sunscreens and hair dyes. Beauty companies in the US are not obligated to conduct animal tests by any government policy. However, there are insufficient regulations to prevent a company from testing products on animals.
  </p>
  <p>
  An example of animal testing is the skin and eye irritation tests, where animals have their eyes and shaved skin exposed to chemicals. Of course, they don’t administer pain relief while the animals suffer in restraints. Another cruel test is the lethal dose test, where researchers inject animals with a lethal dosage of chemicals to single out fatally toxic chemicals.
  </p>
  <p>
  Testing facilities usually put down animals that do not die from the rigors of lab tests through asphyxiation, neck-breaking, or decapitation. In the United States, a large percentage of lab animals do not enjoy any protection under the Animal Welfare Act.
