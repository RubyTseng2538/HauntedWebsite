  About 8 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean each year, and cosmetic containers inevitably contribute in no small measure. Some of these plastics wash ashore and become an eyesore, but plastic pollution has more devastating consequences.
</p>
<p>
  Plastic waste is a severe environmental issue. On land and in water bodies, plastic waste is both an eyesore and a pollutant. Plastic is not biodegradable, which means that it will not decompose. However, it goes through a process called photodegradation which breaks it down into microscopic sizes. This process takes between 100 to 500 years to complete, depending on the type of plastic. The UN environmental program has warned that if the waste trend continues, there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish by 2050.
</p>
<p>
  Millions of birds and fish die from the complications of plastic being in and around the sea. From entanglement to blockage of the digestive tract, plastic bits and pieces slowly and painfully kill sea life. Large land animals have also died from eating plastic.
  </p>
  <p>
  Scientists have confirmed that ingesting microplastic can cause specific genetic mutations and changes in fish behaviors.
  </p>
  <p>
  Plastic pollution is not only affecting marine life. Humans are at risk too. Researchers have discovered plastic microfibers have to be airborne and found in tap water. Furthermore, they have discovered microplastics in over 100 aquatic species consumed by humans.
