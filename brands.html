  Packaging in the beauty industry is less practical and more fanciful. Beauty brands seem to go all out for packaging. 
  Often the more expensive or luxurious a product is, the more nonessential packaging you may expect to find. 
  About 70% of the beauty industry’s waste comes from packaging.</p>
<p>
  According to the latest reports from Zero Waste Week, beauty packaging amounts to 120 billion units every year. 
  That includes plastic, paper, glass, and metals, all of which end up in landfills year after year.

  Recycling is not always straightforward with cosmetic packaging because brands make most boxes, bags, and containers 
  with mixed materials. Even when the components are separable, it is usually a waste of time for recycling workers. 
  Although consumers can help by separating the pieces themselves, it is not convenient. 
  56% of British people do not recycle shampoo or shower gel bottles because it is stressful to do so.
