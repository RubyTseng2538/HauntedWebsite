  Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are air pollutants found in cleaning agents, printing inks, pesticides, and wood finishings. It is also present in some beauty products like perfumes, deodorants, and hair sprays. A recent study has revealed that these products are significantly contributing to carbon dioxide emissions. The study showed that household and beauty product emissions contribute to half of the VOCs emitted in 33 urban cities.

  Let's not forget the carbon footprint of the myriad of fossil fuel-derived materials used in beauty products and packaging throughout the global cosmetics industry. Even with natural ingredients extracted and processed in unsustainable ways, carbon pollution is a significant concern.
