  To make way for plantations that provide an abundance of plant-based raw materials for the beauty industry, producers have cleared extensive areas of natural forests. They also cut trees to make tons of cardboard boxes, paper wraps, and packing tissues that consumers throw away as soon as they begin using the product.
</p>
<p>
Packaging from tree-based products consumes 18 million acres of forest every year. Such large-scale industrial deforestation has contributed significantly to global warming. Trees are carbon sequesters, and cutting them down releases co2 back into the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
Rapid deforestation not only contributes to climate change but also affects biodiversity negatively. Native plants and wildlife populations are dwindling. The World Wildlife Foundation reports that the wildlife population has decreased by 68% since 1970. Sadly, the trend continues even today.
